        <h1>Regalia Returns & Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>
          At Regalia, we stand behind the quality of our products and want every purchase to be a positive experience. We understand, however, that sometimes a product may not be what you expected it to be. In that unlikely event, we invite you to review the following terms related to returning a product.
        </p>

        <h2>Returns and Exchanges</h2>
        <p>
          For any Regalia products purchased directly from our online store, returns and exchanges can be made within 30 days of receipt, provided the items are in their original condition, with all original packaging and any included accessories and documentation.
        </p>

        <h2>Non-returnable Items</h2>
        <p>
          Certain types of items cannot be returned, like custom products (such as special orders or personalized items) and personal care goods (such as beauty products). Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your specific item.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Return</h2>
        <p>
          To initiate a return, please contact our customer service team at [Your Customer Service Contact Information]. Provide your order number, the items you wish to return, and the reason for the return. We will provide you with instructions on how to send the items back to us.
        </p>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Once we receive and inspect your return, we will notify you if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.
        </p>

        <h2>Exchanges</h2>
        <p>
          The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.
        </p>

        <h2>Shipping Costs</h2>
        <p>
          Customers are responsible for return shipping costs unless the item is defective or an incorrect item was shipped. Shipping costs are non-refundable.
        </p>

        <p>
          We hope you love what you ordered, but if something isn’t right, let us know. We’re here to help.
